BS. Peking University 2021/09-2025/06(expected)

College of Engineering, majoring in Theoretical and Applied mechanics


Academic Interests
======

Currently, my academic interests primarily lie at the intersection of applied and computational mathematics and fluid dynamics. I believe that mathematics, physics, and computation are reflections of nature at different levels, with a beautiful and deeply meaningful unity within them. I hope that by building on my academic foundation in these three areas, I can grasp their deeper unity, better understand nature, and advance technological development.

More specifically, my research interests broadly lie in

- Numerical Analysis

- Partial Differential Equation

- Scientific Machine Learning

Actively looking for discussions and possible collaborations on interesting topics.



Hobbies
======

I have many hobbies, including reading, board games, and walking. I have a wide range of literary interests, with my favorites being Camus's "The Plague," Yukio Mishima's "The Sea of Fertility," and Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment." I love board games, as they can build a coherent and complex game system with just a small rulebook, which fascinates me. I also enjoy walking, which helps me better understand the environment I am in and my inner state. During walks, my thoughts become more active, which helps me solve the problems I face.
