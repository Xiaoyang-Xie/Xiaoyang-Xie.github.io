Hi, I am Xiaoyang Xie, an undergraduate stuent in Peking Uinversity, majoring in Theoretical and Applied mechanics.

Educational Background
======
BS. Peking University 2021/09-2025/06(expected)

College of Engineering, majoring in Theoretical and Applied mechanics.

Academic interests
======
Currently, my academic interests primarily lie at the intersection of applied and computational mathematics and fluid dynamics. I believe that mathematics, physics, and computation are reflections of nature at different levels, with a beautiful and deeply meaningful unity within them. I hope that by building on my academic foundation in these three areas, I can grasp their deeper unity, better understand nature, and advance technological development.

Based on my research interests, in addition to completing the required physics courses in my major, I have also taken many interdisciplinary courses in computational and applied mathematics, such as numerical algebra, PDE, functional analysis, real analysis, machine learning, and others. Through these courses, I believe I have developed a solid mathematical foundation, which will provide a strong basis for my future research.

Research experience
======

So far, I have had three research experiences. At Peking University, I conducted research on the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithm and the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme.

DMD is a data-driven method that extracts modes and their growth/decay rates from time series data, allowing us to predict the future evolution of the system. To avoid instability in predictions, I creatively introduced the Regularized DMD (ReDMD) method to address this issue. Currently, one paper about this research is under review.

The WENO scheme is an important shock-capturing method in computational fluid dynamics, and the HWENO scheme incorporates Hermite interpolation in WENO reconstruction, making the reconstruction template more compact but also leading to instability and increased computational complexity. Building on previous work, I improved the original HWENO scheme and proposed a more robust and efficient HWENO-I scheme. Another paper on this research is currently under review.

Now, I am conducting summer research at the Clima lab at Caltech. I am currently working on improving the design of gravity wave parameterization in global climate model.


Hobbies
======

I have many hobbies, including reading, board games, and walking. I have a wide range of literary interests, with my favorites being Camus's "The Plague," Yukio Mishima's "The Sea of Fertility," and Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment." I love board games, as they can build a coherent and complex game system with just a small rulebook, which fascinates me. I also enjoy walking, which helps me better understand the environment I am in and my inner state. During walks, my thoughts become more active, which helps me solve the problems I face.
